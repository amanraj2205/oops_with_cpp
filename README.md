# OOPS in C++ | 3rd Semester Engineering üßë‚Äçüíª

Welcome\! This repository contains a collection of C++ programs designed to demonstrate the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)**. This collection is specifically curated for 3rd-semester engineering students to help with lab assignments and exam preparation.

-----

## üéØ Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to provide simple, well-commented, and easy-to-understand C++ code examples for all major OOPS topics. Each program focuses on a specific concept, making it easier to learn and revise.

-----

## ‚ú® Core Concepts Covered

This repository covers the fundamental pillars of OOPS, including but not limited to:

  * **Classes and Objects:** The basic building blocks of OOPS.
  * **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on the data.
  * **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.
  * **Inheritance:**
      * Single Inheritance
      * Multiple Inheritance
      * Multilevel Inheritance
      * Hierarchical Inheritance
  * **Polymorphism:**
      * **Compile-time:** Function Overloading & Operator Overloading
      * **Run-time:** Virtual Functions & Method Overriding
  * **Constructors and Destructors:** Special methods for object initialization and cleanup.
  * **Friend Functions and Classes:** Granting non-member functions/classes access to private members.
  * **Templates:** Writing generic programs for different data types.
  * **Exception Handling:** Managing runtime errors using `try-catch` blocks.
  * **File Handling:** Reading from and writing to files (`fstream`).

## üöÄ How to Use

To use these programs, you'll need a C++ compiler installed on your system (like GCC/G++).

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amanraj2205/oops_with_cpp.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**

    ```bash
    cd oops_with_cpp
    ```

3.  **Compile a program:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and use the `g++` compiler.

    ```bash
    g++ program_name.cpp -o output_executable
    ```

    *(Replace `program_name.cpp` with the file you want to compile and `output_executable` with your desired output file name.)*

4.  **Run the compiled program:**

    ```bash
    ./output_executable
    ```
